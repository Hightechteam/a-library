# a-library 


## about

**a-library** is simply that a library. Or more specifically, it is an offline digital library; a localised wifi network that hosts a free and open collection of documents. **a-library** was developed as a way for us to easily share books and articles with each other, and in the process to collectively develop a local archive of all the publications that are meaningful to us. By us, I mean you and I. even if we have not personally met, we have shared this location, and these texts are now between us.

**a-library** is currently installed in a number of physical locations. To access **a-library** visit [frontyard](www.frontyardprojects.org).
